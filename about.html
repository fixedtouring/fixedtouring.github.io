<h1>About</h1>

<p>
  Fixed Touring established in 2012 is a not for profit bicycle advocacy
  organization. Fixed Touring provides unique opportunities for Dallas/Fort
  Worth cyclists to increase bicycle skills, maintenance and route knowledge
  across the state while decreasing the amount of gears.

<p>
  The goal of Fixed Touring is to promote and showcase reliable, self
  sufficient, and logical means to physical activity... 1 gear &amp; 1 bike at a
  time. Comprised of five officers and two members from a variety of backgrounds
  and professions, Fixed Touring is organized just as diverse as the areas we
  seek to serve. Fixed Touring seeks to increase awareness of cycling and active
  lifestyle events, promote community-wide physical fitness, and benefit
  partnering companies/organizations. Fixed Touring’s strategy is to influence
  participation in regular physical activity by associating it with sustainable
  transportation, promoting cycling awareness, reaching physical activity
  requirements, spending time with friends, having fun, and seeing the country
  on two wheels. Fixed Touring will target riders/non-riders alike and a focus
  will be placed on developing cycling communities, enhancing cycling awareness,
  developing active transportation infrastructure and promoting community
  cycling events. Fixed Touring seeks to improve citizen’s attitudes,
  self-efficacy and perception through a person-oriented and community-driven
  program, successfully implementing bicycle touring and transportation in
  conjunction with the recently passed Dallas Bike Plan, local business funding
  and community organization support.
