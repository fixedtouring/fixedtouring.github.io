2 days. 180 miles. A weekend of bike riding and beer drinking from start to
finish.

This October 18th and 19th Fixed Touring is riding from Dallas out to Athens, TX
and back.

Traditionally this is a fixed gear ride, however geared bikes are welcome.

We are going to meet in Saturday morning at BuzzBrews in Deep Ellum. Day one we
will ride out to Athens approximately 90 miles, Hang out in Athens saturday
night and ride back home for a finish line party. We will post official
distances once the route is finalized.

Prices is $80 for the whole trip. After Oct. 13th the price will go up to $100
so don’t wait to register.

We need full payment to reserve a spot on the ride.

Cost includes:

- Accommodations in Athens.
- Food, water, energy drinks and *beer* while on the road.
- Support cars with our gear, spare parts, tools and mechanical support. (Cost
  of gas for the SAG cars is included)

The route will be fully mapped and we will provide it once finalized.

We will stop for good full lunches. Each night is a party. Full SAG support,
food and beverages on road, and motel rooms are included.

During the ride we like to compete in a gentlemen’s points race. Every city and
county line is a sprint for points. First to cross gets 5 points, second 4,
third 3, fourth 2, and fifth gets 1 point. County lines are worth double. There
must be a posted sign on the route for it to count. But you must also ride with
ride with the group, stopping at turns and occasional beer stop. Winner gets
respect or another beer or something.
